The Hibernate ORM 7.0 Beta1 release has just been published.  Here are some highlights...


[[jpa-32]]
== Jakarta Persistence 3.2

7.0 migrates to Jakarta Persistence 3.2 which can be fairly disruptive.  See the link:{migration-guide-url}#jpa-32[Migration Guide] for details.

See https://in.relation.to/2024/04/01/jakarta-persistence-3/[this blog post] for a summary of the changes in 3.2

- https://ci.hibernate.org/view/ORM/job/hibernate-orm-tck-3.2/job/wip%252F7.0/24/[TCK Results] with Java 17
- https://ci.hibernate.org/view/ORM/job/hibernate-orm-tck-3.2/job/wip%252F7.0/25/[TCK Results] with Java 21

[[java-17]]
== Java 17

Version 3.2 of Jakarta Persistence requires Java 17.  Hibernate 7.0 therefore baselines on Java 17 whereas previous versions baseline on Java 11.

[[model-validations]]
== Domain Model Validations

7.0 does much more validation of an application's domain model and especially its mapping details, e.g.

* illegal combinations such as `@Basic` and `@ManyToOne` on the same attribute
* misplaced annotations such as an annotated getter method with FIELD access
* stricter following of JavaBean conventions

See the link:{migration-guide-url}#annotation-validation[Migration Guide] for details.

[[mapping-xml]]
== mapping.xsd

Hibernate 7.0 provides a new XSD that represents an "extension" of the Jakarta Persistence orm.xsd weaving in Hibernate-specific mapping features.  The namespace for this extended mapping is `http://www.hibernate.org/xsd/orm/mapping`

For applications using Hibernate's legacy `hbm.xml` format, we provide a tool to help with the transformation.
See the link:{migration-guide-url}#hbm-transform[Migration Guide] for details.


[[hibernate-models]]
== Hibernate Models

7.0 migrates from https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-commons-annotations/[Hibernate Commons Annotations] (HCANN) to the new https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-models[Hibernate Models] project for low-level processing of an application domain model, reading annotations and weaving in XML mapping documents.

See the link:{migration-guide-url}#hibernate-models[Migration Guide] for details.

[[json-and-xml-functions]]
== JSON and XML functions

Support for most of the JSON and XML functions that the SQL standard specifies was added to HQL/Criteria.
The implementations retain the SQL standard semantics and will throw an error if emulation on a database is impossible.

New functions include:

* construction functions like `json_array()`, `json_object()`, `xmlelement()` and `xmlforest()`
* query functions like `json_value()`, `json_query()` and `xmlquery()`
* aggregation functions like `json_agg()`, `json_object_agg()` and `xmlagg()`
* manipulation functions like `json_set()`, `json_mergepatch()`
* any many more

NOTE: The functions are incubating/tech-preview and to use them in HQL,
it is necessary to enable the `hibernate.query.hql.json_functions_enabled` and `hibernate.query.hql.xml_functions_enabled` configuration settings.

[[set-returning-functions]]
== Set-returning functions

A set-returning function is a new type of function that can return rows and is exclusive to the `from` clause.
The concept is known in many different database SQL dialects and is sometimes referred to as table valued function or table function.

Custom set-returning functions can be registered via a `FunctionContributor`.
Out-of-the-box, some common set-returning functions are already supported or emulated

* `unnest()` - allows to turn an array into rows
* `generate_series()` - can be used to create a series of values as rows
* `json_table()` - turns a JSON document into rows
* `xmltable()` - turns an XML document into rows

[[cleanup]]
== Clean-up

A lot of deprecated contracts and behavior has been removed.  See the link:{migration-guide-url}#cleanup[Migration Guide] for details.
