This guide discusses migration to Hibernate ORM version 6.5. For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

[[java-time]]
== Java Time Handling

6.5 adds support for marshalling Java Time objects directly through the JDBC driver as defined by JDBC 4.2.
In previous versions, Hibernate would handle Java Time objects using `java.sql.Date`, `java.sql.Time` or
`java.sql.Timestamp` references as intermediate forms.

Another behavioral change with this is handling for timezones.  `OffsetDateTime`, `OffsetTime` and
`ZonedDateTime` all encode explicit timezone information.  With direct marshalling, Hibernate simply
passes along the value as-is.  In the legacy behavior, since the `java.sql` variants do not
encode timezone information, Hibernate generally has to specially handle timezones when converting to
those intermediate forms.

For 6.5 this behavior is disabled by default.  To opt-in,

It is expected the default will flip for 7.0.

[[query-cache-layout]]
== Query cache layout change

In Hibernate ORM 6.0 the query cache layout changed from a "shallow" representation of entities and collections,
to a "full" representation. This was done to enable to re-materialize join fetched data from just the query cache data.

Storing the full data in the query cache leads to a higher memory consumption,
which in turn might also hurt application throughput due to a higher garbage collection activity.

Hibernate ORM 6.5 introduces means to configure the query cache layout globally via the `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout`
property, and also for an entity type or persistent collection with the `@QueryCacheLayout` annotation.

The global `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout` setting defaults to the `AUTO` value,
which will automatically choose `SHALLOW` or `FULL` for an entity/collection,
depending on whether the entity/collection is cacheable.

Applications that want to retain the `FULL` cache layout that Hibernate ORM 6.0 used should configure
the global property `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout=FULL`.
Applications that want the cache layout that Hibernate ORM 5 and older versions used should configure
the global property `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout=SHALLOW`.

Note that even with the shallow cache layout, the association eagerness implied through join fetches will be respected,
and associations will be eagerly initialized, so there is no change of behavior when choosing a different cache layout.

[[ddl-implicit-datatype-enum]]
== Datatype for enums
Hibernate ORM 6.5 now uses the `ENUM` datatype for `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` enumeration mappings by default on H2,
just like link:{docsBase}/6.2/migration-guide/migration-guide.html#ddl-implicit-datatype-enum[ORM 6.2 already started doing for MySQL/MariaDB].

The change is backwards compatible, though schema validation might produce an error now as the expected type is `enum`,
whereas it was `varchar` of `char` before. To revert to the original mapping,
annotate the enum attribute with `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.VARCHAR)` or `@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255)")`.
