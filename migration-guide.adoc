This guide discusses migration to Hibernate ORM version 6.5. For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

[[java-time]]
== Java Time Handling

6.5 adds support for marshalling Java Time objects directly through the JDBC driver as defined by JDBC 4.2.
In previous versions, Hibernate would handle Java Time objects using `java.sql.Date`, `java.sql.Time` or
`java.sql.Timestamp` references as intermediate forms.

Another behavioral change with this is handling for timezones.  `OffsetDateTime`, `OffsetTime` and
`ZonedDateTime` all encode explicit timezone information.  With direct marshalling, Hibernate simply
passes along the value as-is.  In the legacy behavior, since the `java.sql` variants do not
encode timezone information, Hibernate generally has to specially handle timezones when converting to
those intermediate forms.

For 6.5 this behavior is disabled by default.  To opt-in,

[source]
----
hibernate.type.prefer_java_type_jdbc_types=true
----

It is expected the default will flip for 7.0.

[[query-cache-layout]]
== Configurable Query Cache Layout

In Hibernate ORM 6.0 the query cache layout changed from a "shallow" representation of entities and collections,
to a "full" representation. This was done to support re-materializing join fetched data from the query cache data
without hitting the database.  Storing the full data in the query cache leads to a higher memory consumption,
which in turn might also hurt application throughput due to a higher garbage collection activity.

6.5 adds the ability to configure the format in which query results are stored in the query cache, either

* globally via the `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout` setting
* per entity or collection via the `@QueryCacheLayout` annotation

The global `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout` setting defaults to the `AUTO` value,
which will automatically choose `SHALLOW` or `FULL` for an entity/collection,
depending on whether the entity/collection is cacheable.

Applications that want to retain the `FULL` cache layout that Hibernate ORM 6.0 used should configure
the global property `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout=FULL`.
Applications that want the cache layout that Hibernate ORM 5 and older versions used should configure
the global property `hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout=SHALLOW`.

[NOTE]
====
Even with the `SHALLOW` cache layout, the association eagerness implied through join fetches will be respected,
and associations will be eagerly initialized. So there is no change of behavior when choosing a different cache layout.

With `SHALLOW`, Hibernate might need to hit the database to materialize the associated data *if it does not exist in the second level cache*.

[[ddl-implicit-datatype-enum]]
== Datatype for enums (H2)

Hibernate ORM 6.5 now uses the `ENUM` datatype for `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` enumeration mappings by default on H2,
just like link:{docsBase}/6.2/migration-guide/migration-guide.html#ddl-implicit-datatype-enum[ORM 6.2 already started doing for MySQL/MariaDB].

The change is backwards compatible, though schema validation might produce an error now as the expected type is `enum`,
whereas it was `varchar` of `char` before. To revert to the original mapping,
annotate the enum attribute with `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.VARCHAR)` or `@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255)")`.


[[jdbc-metadata-on-boot]]
== hibernate.boot.allow_jdbc_metadata_access

6.5 adds a new setting named `hibernate.boot.allow_jdbc_metadata_access` as a supported replacement for
the legacy `hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults` setting which was only ever considered internal and
unsupported for use by applications (as should have been obvious from the name).

This setting controls whether Hibernate should be allowed to access the JDBC `DatabaseMetaData` during bootstrapping.
With this setting enabled (the default), Hibernate will access the `DatabaseMetaData` to perform some internal
configuration based on the reported capabilities of the underlying database.  Disabling this setting requires
explicit settings for this configuration.  At a minimum this includes:

* `hibernate.dialect` or `jakarta.persistence.database-product-name` to indicate the type of database
* `jakarta.persistence.database-product-version` to indicate the database version


[[query-result-validation]]
== Validation of Query Result Type

6.5 does more stringent checks that the reported query result type (if one) matches the actual query return type.
This will show up as a `org.hibernate.TypeMismatchException`.


[[sql-expectation]]
== SQL Execution Expectation

6.5 moves away from an enumeration approach to specifying the expected outcome of specific SQL executions to
a more extendable approach of directly specifying the `Expectation` implementation to use.
`ExecuteUpdateResultCheckStyle` and `ResultCheckStyle` approaches are still available, though deprecated.

The enumerated values are replaced by -

* `org.hibernate.jdbc.Expectation.None`
* `org.hibernate.jdbc.Expectation.RowCount`
* `org.hibernate.jdbc.Expectation.OutParameter`

To update, change e.g.

[source,java]
----
@SQLInsert(check=ResultCheckStyle.COUNT)
----

to

[source,java]
----
@SQLInsert(verify=Expectation.RowCount.class)
----


[[uk-naming]]
== Unique Key Naming

Previous 6.x versions did not apply `ImplicitNamingStrategy` when determining the name of a unique key implicitly.


[[annotation-problems]]
== Annotation Problems

6.5 makes various problems in annotations errors (fail fast) as opposed to logged warnings.


[[annotation-processor-rename]]
== Annotation Processor Rename

The name of Hibernate's Annotation Processor has been changed to `org.hibernate.processor.HibernateProcessor`.
This change will not affect most users as such processors are normally discovered from the `javac` "processor path", but is important to know for users using the processor manually.

[[jakarta-data]]
== Jakarta Data

6.5 adds support for the Jakarta Data specification, though this support is considered tech preview as the specification is still being actively developed.


[[auto-flush]]
== Auto Flush

The auto flush event has been split in two parts a pre-partialFlush and a partialFlush and in order to track the start and the end fo the pre-partialFlush two new methods (`void prePartialFlushStart()` and
`void prePartialFlushEnd()`) have been added to the `SessionEventListener`.
