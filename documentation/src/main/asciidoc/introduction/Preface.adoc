Hibernate 6 is a major redesign of the world's most popular and feature-rich ORM solution.
The redesign has touched almost every subsystem of Hibernate, including the APIs, mapping annotations, and the query language.
This new Hibernate is more powerful, more robust, and more typesafe.

With so many improvements, it's very difficult to summarize the significance of this work.
But the following general themes stand out.
Hibernate 6:

- finally takes advantage of the advances in relational databases over the past decade, updating the query language to support a raft of new constructs in modern dialects of SQL,
- exhibits much more consistent behavior across different databases, greatly improving portability, and generates much higher-quality DDL from dialect-independent code,
- improves error reporting by more scrupulous validation of queries _before_ access to the database,
- improves the type-safety of O/R mapping annotations, clarifies the separation of API, SPI, and internal implementation, and fixes some long-standing architectural flaws,
- removes or deprecates legacy APIs, laying the foundation for future evolution, and
- makes far better use of Javadoc, putting much more information at the fingertips of developers.

Hibernate 6 and Hibernate Reactive are now core components of Quarkus 3, the most exciting new environment for cloud-native development in Java, and Hibernate remains the persistence solution of choice for almost every major Java framework or server.

Unfortunately, the changes in Hibernate 6 have obsoleted much of the information about Hibernate that's available in books, in blog posts, and on stackoverflow.

On the other hand, the Hibernate {user-guide}[User Guide] provides a great deal of detail about many aspects of Hibernate, but with so much information to cover, readability is difficult to achieve.

This is therefore the new canonical guide to Hibernate.
We do not attempt to cover every detail of Hibernate here, and so this guide should be used in conjunction with the extensive Javadoc available for Hibernate 6.
